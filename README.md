## How do I approach designing software?
When working on a large project like this one, I usually take a slower approach by first planning out how I want to create the program. Once I have a rough idea of how I want the program to function, then I start breaking that down into individual parts and start coding those. 
## How do I approach developing programs?
Taking a cautious and sequential approach to software development is a great tactic for future work because it helps organize the individual parts of the program in order of importance and this helps get the work done quicker.
## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal in the computer science field is to work in machine learning. Computational Graphics can play a small part by helping visualize the information from the neural networks.
